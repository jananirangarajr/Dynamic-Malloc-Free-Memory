A C program which is a own static library for dynamic allocation using freelists. The library allocates (i.e., malloc) and deallocates (i.e., free).
It does not have support growing the “heap” if out of memory (default mmap). The first Fit strategy for selection is used to allocate the memory.
It contains a sample main program which makes use of the library to allocate and deallocate space.(A sample demo of how to use the library)
It works in all Linux/Unix based system which supports mmap system call.
